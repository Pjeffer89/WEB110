         One of my favorite all time hobbies is Go Kart racing.  I've been riding karts since I was a little kid.  Racing Go Karts is probably dollar for dollar the best way to learn auto racing.  They are incredibly fun and relatively low risk and consequence compared to higher racing classes.  Because of their low overall power, emphasis is placed more on techniques and planning.  Many times racers will rely on power as a crutch to cover up a lack of good techniques.  When you learn these and reinforce them on a lower level like karts the benefits can be huge when moving up.  It's not uncommon to run into famous drivers at your local kart track for this reason.  Not only is it a good way for them to hone their skills, it's also a great way to blow off steam and improve team morale.  For example Lewis Hamilton, a six time Formula One World Champion and regarded as one of the fastest drivers ever got his start in karting.  With all of his successes he still comes back from time to time to play around on his local kart tracks.  One of my favorite places to go is <a href="http://www.gopromotorplex.com/">GoPro Motorplex</a> in Mooresville, NC.  This track is extremely well made and based on a famous course in Italy.  They offer time to kart owners as well as rentals and have great rental karts capable of 55mph.  They also track all of your laps and telemetry allowing you to really practice and see what makes for a faster lap time.  GoPro Motorplex hosts event races and leagues as well so there is always good competition for drivers of all skill levels.
