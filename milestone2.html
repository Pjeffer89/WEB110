      </ul>
      <p class="answer">The goal of this website is to serve as a web presence for the business.  It will inform current or future customers about the business and answer questions about it.  It will also be used to direct customers to the retail location as well as educate them about coffee in general.</p>

        <li>Needed Information and Content</li>
      </ul>
        <p class="answer">I will need photos of menu items and possibly of other things related to the business or coffee history.  I will need to develop a menu and pricing.  There will be a good amount of textual information for the about and history pages.  The reviews will have to be created as well.  The text I will primarily write.  I will likely source articles as needed also.  The photos and videos I will try to create myself, but I may source content there as well.</p>
