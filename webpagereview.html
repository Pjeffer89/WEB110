 	<ul>
    	  <li><strong>What is the company/organization?</strong><br>  K Power Industries is a company that specializes in drivetrain swap and upgrades based on the Honda "K" series engine.  They develop and sell the parts necessary to use this engine in other vehicles that were never designed to fit it.  They also develop solutions to fortify other aspects of the driveline to handle the extra power in a racing environment. </li>
    	  <li><strong>What is the URL?</strong><br><a href="https://kpower.industries/">https://kpower.industries/</a></li>
    	  <li><strong>What is the purpose of the site?</strong><br>  This site advertises and sells the products recommended by or developed by K Power Industries.  It also includes information and thorough documentation on how items are designed to work as well as news on upcoming new products.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Who is the intended audience?</strong><br>  This site is intended for current or future customers primarily.  It is also very useful for anyone trying to swap one of these engines by providing technical data.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Do you believe the site reaches its audience?</strong><br>  Yes.  There are very few companies doing what they have been able to do.  Being so specialized in what they do makes them easy to find for anyone interested.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Was the site useful to you? Why or why not?</strong><br> This site has been extremely helpful to me.  I was able to make a huge amount of headway on a project car I am currently building by using their products and documentation.</li>
    	  <li><strong>List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of this website, etc.</strong><br>  The home page has lots of pictures that will navigate you to certain products.  There is a large slide show image at the top to advertise new products.  Below the main image is a feature section to highlight a notable build.  There is a more traditional navigation list on the left of the page which expands to more specific categories.  There is a form at the bottom to subscribe your email to a newsletter.  Also in the footer are links to social media as well as a contact method.</li>
